<h1>Customer Segmentation Analysis</h1>
<h2>Project Overview</h2><br>
This project focuses on customer segmentation using clustering techniques. By analyzing spending behaviors and demographic data, we identify different customer groups to help businesses understand their target audience.<br>

<h3>Business Questions Answered</h3><br>
1)Who are the high-spending customers?<br>

Customers aged 20-40 have the highest spending scores, indicating a preference for luxury or premium products.<br>
2)Who are the low-spending customers?<br>

Customers above 40 tend to spend less, possibly due to budget-conscious behavior or a shift in priorities toward necessities.<br>
3)Are there any surprising patterns?<br>

A sharp decline in spending scores after age 40 suggests a change in consumer habits, which businesses should consider for targeted marketing strategies.<br>
4)Who are the least profitable customers?<br>

Customers with low annual income and low spending scores contribute the least to overall revenue.<br>
